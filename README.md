EarthCoin 2.x
=============

EarthCoin was born 20 December 2013 and reborn 13 January 2017 with a new agenda focused on giving back to the Earth.

  - EarthCoin will begin development on multi-algorithm mining using its original Scrypt and adding X11 and SHA-256 with the intention of giving those who have left the GPU mining community to take up mining with SHA-256 ASICs the ability of contirbuting a little hash to assist EarthCoin in meeting its goal of providing capital to legally registered non-profits focused on helping our ecosystem.
  
  - EarthCoin will provide non-profits with funds to help further their cause by allocating 10% of its block rewards to a donation account kept in escrow and overseen by elected members of the community.  This escrow account can only be distributed after a non-profit is selected by the community and all elected officers agree to distribution thereby giving no single individual control of funds.
  
  - Having a worthy cause behind EarthCoin, I believe it will find new and long lasting support therefor increasing its value for miners, as well as, those receiving donations from our orginization.  
  
  - Those interested in contributing may contact me at earthcoin2@gmail.com.  Thank you, Aaron Pearson (aka: stonedpuppy1)
  
EarthCoin will have a new website at earthcoin.us soon!

Original EarthCoin mission staement

Our goal isn’t to compete, as much as compliment, create balance, and not divert into launching a coin because we can. Instead, we’d like to see what kind of actual substance and value we can create with a coin that represents us all. No matter what race, age, ethnicity, we’re all a part of this beautiful planet, and who knows this little idea might be enough to unite some/many of us! 

Birth date: 20 December 2013

Block Rewards (May be changing in this upcoming release)

Besides its very fast transaction speed, Earthcoin is unique in the way it is mimcs the seasonal cycles of Earth. The mining rewards system of EarthCoin follows the same type of 365 day cycle as we do in our daily life similar to the earth moving around the sun. And like the equator is moving, so is the amount of coins being released to the miners. For example: in the 1st year of its release, the coins released to the miners were 10,000 per day starting to work to a positive deviation of 2,000 extra coins after 3 months, then falling back to its original 10,000 coins after 6 months to end up with a -2,000 deviation after 9 months. At the end of the year the amount would then return to 10,000.

### 14 days

In addition to following the equator, EarthCoin also introduced the full moon cycle. This cycle is translated to a double release of coins to all the miners mining for EarthCoins. This is also know as a X2 payout.

### 31 Days

Earthcoin also incorporated the other well known moon cycle called month. But in this scenario, the amount of released coins is a five fold of normal. This is also known as a X5 payout.

----------------

Maximum amount of EarthCoins (Possible changes coming here also)

The mechanism of EarthCoins allows only a certain amount of coins to be released. The above mentioned cycles will last for a year and are then halved. This will eventually result in a total maximum of 13.5 billion coins which equals the date of the universe in years. So miners will not be able to find anymore coins than this maximum but will be allowed to find “replacement coins”. These “replacement coins” can be regarded as the amount of coins lost while transferring coins between different addresses. To avoid a decrease of the amount of existing coins, a small amount of coins will still be minable.

----------------

Transaction speed

The mechanism behind EarthCoin which is based on peer-to-peer, allows transactions to happen very quickly. This means that once you pay or get payed with EarthCoin, the time taken to see the money transferred is equal or sometimes faster than the avarege debit card. EarthCoin promotes transaction times of approximatly 30 seconds where it is actually closer to 10-15 seconds which is nowadays regarded as being instant. The true strength behind this speed is the abillity to use it in any store in the near future with the same feel of speed as the currency you hold today
